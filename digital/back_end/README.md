Untar the rail65.tar.gz file, it is the FRAM_ONLY Milkyway library for placement and routing.

# CEL_FRAM Milkyway Library

It can be generated as long as you have the *rail65.gds* file.
The *mkw_append_cell_new.sch* is a referece scheme script that converts the gds into the CEL_FRAM library. 
Launch Milkyway and load the file. (Make sure the GDS-II exists as the path "gds/rail65.gds").

The complete CEL_FRAM Milkyway Library / rail65.gds is only availabe if users can provide NDA with TSMC.
